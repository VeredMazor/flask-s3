# Flask Web Application with AWS S3 Integration
### Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to sign up, sign in, and view a home page with an image retrieved from an AWS S3 bucket. The application uses SQLAlchemy for database management and Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations. User credentials are securely managed, and session management is implemented to ensure user security.

### Features
User registration and authentication
Integration with AWS S3 to display an image on the home page
Database management using SQLAlchemy
Secure handling of environment variables using python-dotenv
